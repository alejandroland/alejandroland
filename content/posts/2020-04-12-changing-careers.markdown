Here I am, changing careers.

From office clerk to Front-end Developer.

From law school to online learning.

I’ve been interested in Software Development for a long time. In fact, I studied Computer Science but halfway I got a job opportunity and at that time I cared more about the money.

After dropping out from Computer Science and after a couple of years working I went to law school. It was related to what I did so I thought it was a better choice.

Fast forward towards the end of 2019 and the Software Development call was too strong for me to ignore so I took all my savings, enrolled in a couple online programs and prepared for my career change.

Now, in the middle of this crisis and not having a job gives me anxiety, I don’t have that much of a runway but I think that the change to tech and software was the right choice.

Overall, I’m excited. The last few months I learned A LOT and I’m confident of my skills and commitment.

Our world is changing fast. We need to be able to change fast too.
