title: "Alternative Vegan"

I’m aware of health and environmental benefits of a vegetarian diet. (For me the environmental part is more important)

I eat meat.

I don’t like vegan people demonizing people who eat meat, and here’s why:

As a person that wasn’t aware of the big picture and ate meat practically on every meat I’ve been reducing my meat and dairy intake.

The reason is that the discussion is presented as some kind of battle between two diets.

Either you are in one group or the other. And as usual when people get too polarized none of them tend to be right.

Now, as someone who understands the benefits of a vegan diet AND likes to eat meat sometimes; I think that demonizing people who eat meat takes those people further away from going vegan (or at least less carnivore) which is the main reason of pointing out the advantages of a vegan diet.

Where I live there aren’t good alternatives to meat like Impossible Foods or Beyond Meat. So that’s why I haven’t had the opportunity and willpower to go meatless.

So I like to call this approach “Alternative Vegan” and wipe out the mindset that if people aren’t going to do it perfectly then they shouldn’t even try.

Our planet needs more people doing it imperfectly than a few doing it perfectly. Just as in Zero-Waste, but I’ll write about that in another post.

Let’s stop thinking about this as a “better than others” issue and start thinking as a “better for the planet and ourselves” issue.

Also, maybe this “Alternative Vegan” is the first step towards Full-Vegan.
