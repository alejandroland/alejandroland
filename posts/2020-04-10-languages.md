I LOVE languages.

I want to learn them all, that’s the reason I haven’t decided to focus on one yet. A few german lessons and while binge watching YouTube I hear Italian, so I look for some Italian lessons. Then while scrolling on Instagram I see some Chinese characters, now I HAVE to know what they mean.

It’s difficult for me as a curious person. I’ve looked a lot of posts about which language to learn first but none of those posts is convincing enough.

My first language is Spanish and I know how to say o couple of things in German, Japanese, Korean, French, Russian, Italian and Portuguese.

I like how Catalan sounds, the cryptic-look of Finnish, Right to left languages like Arabic or Hebrew...

But I think it’s time to focus on one. Or two? Hmm… Can I pick a third one?

Ok here it is: My language learning efforts will focus on: Korean, followed by Italian and German.

Phew, that was a hard decision. But going from who knows how many to only three is a step forward isn’t it?

I’ll be sharing my progress on the following weeks.
